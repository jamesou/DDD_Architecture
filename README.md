# DDD_Architecture
This project mainly constructs a project framework based on the DDD approach using the Java programming language. People can use the project as a demo. You just need to split different models according to their business requirements. You can also use C# or other OOP languages to build your DDD framework referring to this project. Because all of the basic and common components and project modules have already been built.
